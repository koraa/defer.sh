# Defer.sh

## NAME

defer - Delay the execution of a programm with signals

## INVOKE

defer timeout script

## DESCRIPTIION

On the first call, a defer creates a fork
that runs the script after the _timeout_.

Each successive call to defer delays the execution of the _script_.

Please note, that these calls are not delaying the invocation by
a specific duration. Think  of it more like of a keepalive:
If _defer_  has not been called since _timeout_, the _script_ will
be executed.

Also note, that each defer is identified by all its argumeents
(more precise: "$0 $@").
This means, that each ooof the following calls  are completely individual:

```bash
defer 0.1 "echo a" "echo b"
defer 0.2 "echo a" "echo b"
defer 0.2 "echo  a" "echo b"
```

## EXAMPLES

My motivation for writing this, was to display mmmy tmux status bar
only when holding  down a key, so I added this to my config::

```bash
bind -nr ^ run-shell -b "defer 0.15 'tmux set -g status off'  'tmux set -g status on' 2>/dev/null >/dev/null"
```

This means: While circumflex is pressed invoke the comand given in regular
intervals.
